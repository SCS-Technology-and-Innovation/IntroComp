        "**What is an IPv6 Address?**\n",
        "\n",
        "An IPv6 address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. IPv6 stands for Internet Protocol version 6, which is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol (IP). IPv6 was developed to replace IPv4, primarily because IPv4 addresses were running out.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Format of IPv6 Addresses**\n",
        "\n",
        "IPv6 addresses are written in a format known as \"colon-hexadecimal notation,\" which consists of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons. Each group can range from 0000 to FFFF in hexadecimal (base 16).\n",
        "\n",
        "For example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334\n",
        "\n",
        "2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334:\n",
        "1. This is a standard example of an IPv6 address.\n",
        "2. Each part of the address (e.g., 2001, 0db8, 85a3, etc.) is called a \"hextet\" (hexadecimal digits).\n",
        "3. The address is divided into eight groups of four hexadecimal digits.\n",
        "4. Leading zeros in each group can be omitted. For example, 0db8 can be written as db8.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Simplified Notation**\n",
        "\n",
        "IPv6 addresses can be abbreviated by removing leading zeros within each hextet and by collapsing consecutive sections of zeros into a double colon (::). However, this can only be done once in an address to avoid ambiguity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Original Address: 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 1 (Remove Leading Zeros): 2001:db8:0:0:0:ff00:42:8329\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 2 (Collapse Consecutive Zeros): 2001:db8::ff00:42:8329\n",
        "\n",
        "This final address is easier to read and still represents the same location in the IPv6 address space.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Real-World Example**\n",
        "\n",
        "IPv6 addresses are used to uniquely identify devices on the internet, just like IPv4 addresses. However, IPv6 has a much larger address space, which allows for a vast number of unique addresses.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Summary**\n",
        "\n",
        "An IPv6 address is a 128-bit number used to identify devices on a network. The example 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 is written in colon-hexadecimal notation, with each part called a \"hextet.\" The provided code assigns this address to a variable and prints it out. This format allows for a much larger number of unique addresses compared to IPv4."
